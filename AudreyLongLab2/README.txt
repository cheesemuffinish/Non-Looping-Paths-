 A README files which specifies the version of Java and the IDE use, along with anything else we need to know to
properly compile and execute your code

Welcome to the read me file for my Lab2 code!

The following is the Java version and runtime environment used to create this code: 
java --version
java 10.0.2 2018-07-17
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.3 (build 10.0.2+13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.3 (build 10.0.2+13, mixed mode)


The code takes in an input file from the command line; Currently this code handles IOE exceptions, File not found exceptions, 
and Input mismatch exceptions. 

After the input file has been received the program calculated the paths between nodes and displays the results in an output file

In order to execute the code please do the following:

javac Lab2.java
java Lab2 input1.txt output.txt

then open the output file to see the results!
